class Channel:
    """
    Channel implements a communication channel for persistent asynchronous message exchange between member processes.
    Member processes (short: members) have to explicitly join a common global channel and obtain an identifier.
    Processes are associated with "subgroups" that can be queried to obtain a set of all members (e.g. all "servers").

    Members can use the channel to send/receive a message to/from a set of members or all other members.
    Messages might be any serializable object.

    Internally, the channel manages a set of queues.
    A queue is associates with two channel members: a sender and a receiver.
    It holds all messages from the sender to the receiver.
    Send operations of a caller push messages to respective caller-receiver queues for a set of receivers.
    Receive operations of a caller pop messages from respective sender-caller queues for a set of senders.

    Queues are implemented as redis lists.
    The key is a string representation of a list containing sender and receiver ids.
    That is, sender and receiver can always be identified by parsing the queue keys.

    Redis data Structures:

    Global Member Set
        Key: "members"
        Value: redis set of member ID strings
    Subgroup Member Sets
        Key: <subgroup>
        Value: redis set of member ID strings
    Global Queue List (containing all possible queue keys)
        Key: "xchan"
        Value: redis list of queue identifier objects
    Queues
        Key: "['<member1>','<member2>']"
        Value: redis list of message objects send fom member1 to member2
